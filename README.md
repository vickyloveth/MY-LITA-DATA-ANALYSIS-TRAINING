## EXCEL AND EXCEL FUNCTIONS 
### WHAT IS EXCEL

Microsoft Excel is a versatile spreadsheet software developed by Microsoft, used globally for organizing data and performing financial analysis. Its key features include data entry, management, financial modeling, and charting. Excel is extensively used in finance and accounting for budgeting, forecasting, and analysis due to its robustness and flexibility. It supports various functions, formulas, and shortcuts to enhance productivity and efficiency. Excel is a vital tool for professionals in finance, accounting, and other fields requiring data organization and analysis.

The main uses of Excel include:

- Data entry
- Data management
- Accounting
- Financial analysis
- Charting and graphing
- Programming

### Data Entry

Data entry involves manually or automatically inputting data into a computer system or database. Best practices:

1. Accuracy: Ensure data is entered correctly.
2. Consistency: Use standardized formats.
3. Efficiency: Minimize errors and duplication.

### Data Formatting

Data formatting involves organizing and presenting data in a clear, readable manner.

Types of formatting:

1. Text formatting (uppercase, lowercase, title case)
2. Date formatting (MM/DD/YYYY, DD/MM/YYYY)
3. Numeric formatting (currency, percentages)
4. Data normalization (standardizing data values)

Benefits:

1. Improved readability
2. Enhanced data analysis
3. Better data integration

Data Validation

Data validation ensures data accuracy and consistency by checking for errors or inconsistencies.

Types of validation:

1. Syntax validation (format checks)
2. Range validation (numeric or date ranges)
3. Logical validation (cross-field checks)
4. Data type validation (text, number, date)


Benefits:

1. Reduced errors
2. Improved data quality
3. Enhanced data security
4. Streamlined data processing

Best practices:

1. Validate data at entry point.
2. Use automated validation tools 
3. Provide clear error messages
4. Continuously monitor data quality
   
for example, we're ensuring all columns takes only numbers greater than zero;
- highlight all cells
- go to data tab,click on data tools then click on data validation
- a page pops up, choose allow whole numbers option and click on greater than 0
- then okay
